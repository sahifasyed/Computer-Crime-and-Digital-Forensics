# Project Overview

This repository documents my work for the Computer Crime and Digital Forensics module, focusing on a Hunter XP stalking case investigation. Using EnCase and Autopsy, I conducted a forensic analysis, maintained a contemporaneous investigation log, and produced a witness statement, evidence record, and final report.

## Deliverables & Feedback
- Contempraneous Notes (29/30): Exceptional, detailed, and repeatable notes, covering all tasks to a high standard. Minor additional tasks could have secured a perfect score.
- Witness Statement (16/20): Consistent but lacked signed pages, correct coversheet count, and evidence verification. Some jargon used without explanation.
- Evidence Record (6/10): Utilized but incomplete, missing items that could raise questions about evidence integrity.
- Report (24/40): Well-formatted and impartial, but missing key details (e.g., print artifacts, CD burning) and legislation references, likely due to time constraints.

## Tools Used
- EnCase: For forensic analysis and evidence extraction.
- Autopsy: For additional forensic investigation and validation.
- Regripper: Extracted files from ecase to examine and analyse

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastered forensic investigation processes and tool usage.
- Developed skills in evidence collection, documentation, and reporting.
- Identified areas for improvement in evidence completeness and legislative referencing.

## Feedback Highlights
- Strengths: Near-perfect investigation log, strong understanding of deliverables, and excellent evidence presentation.
- Areas for Improvement: Include all evidence details (e.g., print artifacts), reference relevant legislation, and avoid jargon in statements.
- Overall: Demonstrated potential as a forensic investigator with first-class work, despite minor inconsistencies.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure all evidence items are included in the evidence record.
- Incorporate relevant legislation in the report to align with the marking scheme.
- Sign pages and verify all evidence in the witness statement to enhance credibility.
